        <h2>Lucas Montoya's bio</h2> 
        <p>
            I'm Lucas Montoya, a computer science student passionate about software engineering, programming, and problem-solving. Based in Las Cruces, New Mexico, I’m working toward my degree while continuously refining my skills in C, Java, assembly language and a few others. I thrive on tackling complex challenges—whether it’s optimizing low-level code, designing efficient algorithms, or analyzing data to build innovative solutions.

Before diving into the world of technology, I had the opportunity to play college football at New Mexico Highlands University, an experience that shaped my mindset and work ethic. The discipline, resilience, and strategic thinking I developed on the field now fuel my approach to programming—where precision, adaptability, and execution are just as important.

Beyond coding, I stay active through lifting, running, and playing sports, always pushing myself to improve. I also enjoy working on personal projects, from Arduino and AVR assembly development to data analytics and software engineering. Whether it's debugging an embedded system, refining a predictive model, or designing a new application, I bring the same focus and determination that I had as an athlete.

I’m always looking for ways to expand my knowledge, take on new challenges, and build meaningful software solutions. My goal is to combine technology, problem-solving, and innovation to create impactful projects that make a difference.
