    <p>
        I built this website from scratch as a way to showcase my skills, projects, and interests while reinforcing my understanding of web development. Every line of HTML and CSS was written without the use of frameworks, ensuring that I gained hands-on experience in structuring and styling web content from the ground up. This project allowed me to refine my ability to design a clean, structured layout while also implementing best practices for navigation, organization, and readability. Through this process, I strengthened my understanding of front-end development principles, which complement my broader expertise in programming and software engineering.
        Beyond web development, I have worked on several programming projects that combine my passion for technology, problem-solving, and data analytics. One of my most significant projects is a sports betting odds analyzer, where I developed a system to track betting lines and identify potential inefficiencies in the market. This project involved data scraping, statistical analysis, and algorithmic modeling to determine patterns in betting lines. I used C and Java to build a program that collects and processes real-time data from various sportsbooks, allowing for better-informed betting decisions. The goal of this project was to analyze past trends, calculate expected values, and create an optimized betting strategy.

        Another major project I developed was a Bitcoin price tracker, which utilizes API integration to pull live price data and graph market trends. I implemented predictive modeling techniques to assess potential price fluctuations and provide insights into market movements. This project gave me valuable experience working with real-time data, financial modeling, and data visualization, allowing me to better understand how external factors influence cryptocurrency markets. Through this project, I strengthened my ability to work with APIs, manage large datasets, and analyze financial trends efficiently.
        Additionally, I developed a sports analytics program that takes in historical data from various sports and computes advanced metrics to evaluate player performance. This project combined statistical modeling and data analysis to assess patterns in player statistics and predict potential outcomes for future games. The challenge was in data 
        cleaning, regression modeling, and finding meaningful patterns within large datasets. This project strengthened my ability to work with Python and data analytics libraries, as well as my understanding of statistical modeling in sports.
