    <h2>
        My Interests
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of my strongest interests is programming and technology. As a computer science major, I’m constantly working on projects, coding in multiple languages, and developing my problem-solving skills. I enjoy tackling challenges that require deep thinking, whether it's optimizing algorithms, debugging low-level assembly code, or analyzing data. The process of taking an idea and turning it into something functional and useful is what excites me the most about programming. Whether I’m working with C, Java, or AVR assembly, I find satisfaction in understanding the inner workings of a system and making it operate more efficiently.

        Mathematics and logical problem-solving are also major interests of mine. I’ve spent a lot of time studying discrete math, statistics, and modular arithmetic, and I enjoy using those concepts in real-world applications. I appreciate the structure and precision of math—it allows me to approach problems methodically and create solutions backed by logic. Whether I’m working on an algorithm, analyzing trends, or optimizing a process, I rely on mathematical concepts to guide my decision-making.

        I have a strong curiosity for new technologies, AI, and the future of computing. I’m always researching emerging trends in software development, hardware advancements, and how different technologies integrate into daily life. I enjoy learning about blockchain, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, fascinated by how these innovations are shaping industries and redefining the way we interact with technology. I also follow developments in cybersecurity and cryptography, recognizing the importance of secure digital systems in today’s interconnected world.

        Another area of interest is financial technology and analytics. I enjoy studying how financial markets operate and applying programming skills to analyze trends and data. Understanding probabilities, market movements, and statistical models allows me to approach investments and data-driven decisions with confidence. I find it fascinating how technology is revolutionizing the financial sector, from automated trading algorithms to blockchain-powered transactions.

        Beyond the technical aspects of my interests, I am deeply invested in personal growth and continuous learning. I enjoy reading about high-performance habits, mental resilience, and success strategies. I believe that developing a strong mindset and work ethic is just as important as technical knowledge. Whether it's through books, podcasts, or hands-on experience, I’m always looking for ways to expand my understanding and improve my skills.

        At my core, I am driven by curiosity and a desire to solve problems. Whether it’s through programming, analyzing data, or researching new technology, I find excitement in learning, innovating, and applying knowledge in meaningful ways. I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities to grow and refine my abilities, ensuring that I am always evolving in both my personal and professional life.
