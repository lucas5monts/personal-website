    <h2>
        My Hobbies
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sports and physical activity have always been a big part of my life. I was fortunate enough to play college football at New Mexico Highlands University, an experience that taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. The lessons I learned on the field—strategic thinking, resilience, and execution—carry over into everything I do, whether it's academics, fitness, or personal growth.

        Beyond football, I enjoy golf, basketball, and weightlifting. Golf challenges my patience and precision, requiring mental focus on every shot. Basketball keeps me active with its fast pace and teamwork, while weightlifting is a way for me to push my physical limits and track my progress. I also like running—not to improve speed, but to challenge my endurance and build mental toughness.
        
        Gaming is another hobby of mine, especially in CFB 25 online mode, where I enjoy the competitive aspect of breaking down mechanics, analyzing strategies, and constantly improving. I approach gaming the same way I do sports—by studying patterns, refining techniques, and competing at a high level.
        
        I also have a strong interest in cars and automotive engineering. I enjoy learning about different vehicle technologies, performance tuning, and how engineering impacts design and efficiency. Whether it's sports cars, trucks, or EVs, I appreciate the mechanics behind how they function and the innovation that goes into their development.
        
        Outside of sports and technology, I enjoy cooking and self-improvement. Cooking, for me, is about experimenting, refining skills, and continuously improving. I also see fashion and personal style as a form of self-expression and confidence building. Meditation and reflection are important to me as well, helping me stay focused and disciplined in all aspects of my life.
        
        At the core of all my hobbies is a drive to challenge myself, improve, and learn something new. Whether it's through sports, gaming, cars, or personal growth, I approach everything with a mindset of discipline, strategy, and continuous improvement.
